For a number of years now I've been organizing my life with a daily todo list on
my computer. This has worked really well for a long time, and has brought some
very needed order to my life.

As an Emacs user, I have a list of daily tasks in org-mode which I can view and
complete using org-agenda (with the help of
[`org-recur`](https://github.com/mrcnski/org-recur) and
[`org-super-agenda`](https://github.com/alphapapa/org-super-agenda)).

In fact, keeping a daily todo-list is really quite sufficient for having a
productive life. But recently I've added a *daily planner* to my routine to
supplement my task list. Moreover, I use a *paper planner* instead of a digital
one. I have found this to bring even more structure to my days. But why would
someone do such a thing? How is this different from a todo list? And why paper?

## The Problem

The issue with my todo list is that it is a hodgepodge of tasks and not a
structure for my day. I did add order to it -- high-priority tasks appear first,
for instance, and tasks marked as evening chores appear last. I could add even
more order to it, or figure out ways to dynamically sort it. But that wouldn't
address the fact that this is a list of tasks and not a *plan of attack*.

## The Method

Here's how to do it: at the start of a day, or even the evening before, get some
bullet paper and write down the most important things to do on that day, in the
order they should be done. This forces you to think about order -- e.g. do I go
to the gym first, or do chores first? -- and therefore structure. Keep 3 dots in
between each item. Then, go and add lower-priority items in between.

{% include image.html name="plan-your-day/bullet-paper.jpeg" width="400" alt="Bullet paper." caption="Bullet paper." %}

You can do this to the level of detail that suits you. Just a single-pass of
writing high-priority items works great, and is what I do. If you forget
something, you have plenty of space between items to add it in later.

As you complete items during the day, check them off. If you decide not to do
something, put an `x` next to it. If something gets moved to the next day, put
an arrow: `->`. You can also cross things out, use arrows to move things around,
etc. For example, your plans may depend on whether it rains, or whether you get
a certain response from somebody.

## Example

Let's say you want to journal each day first thing in the morning, but you
always forget about it. Since this is an important item for you, it should be in
the planner:

```
Tue, Mar 14
-----------
*
* Journal
*
```

Now start planning the rest. I've found it works well to plan around meals:

```
Tue, Mar 14
-----------
*
* Journal
*
*
*
* Cook breakfast
*
*
*
* Exercise
*
```

You forgot to include some chores, and also exercising right after breakfast
isn't a good idea. Let's update the list:

```
Tue, Mar 14
-----------
*
* Journal
*
* Buy fresh food
*
* Cook breakfast
* Do laundry
* Work a bit
*
* Exercise
*
```

And that's something you might realistically end up with for the morning. This
process should only take a minute or two. As you go about your day, check things
off:

```
   Tue, Mar 14
   -----------
   *
✓  * Journal
   *
x  * Buy fresh food
   *
✓  * Cook breakfast
✓  * Do laundry
✓  * Work a bit
   *
→  * Exercise
   *
```

## Final Notes

That's pretty much it. It's a simple technique, but it:

1. forces you to think about your day up-front and how you want to approach it.
2. gives you a plan of attack that you can easily execute on.
3. is flexible and modifiable.

I use paper because I bought some fancy, high-quality pens and notebooks and
need some reason to use them. Also, writing with such tools is quite enjoyable
-- I recommend people try them! More importantly though, it's nice to have
something physical to look at as you go about your day. I can't really explain
why, but just try it.

Remember that this is a supplement to a digital task list. Use the todo list as
a reference for your planner.

This same technique can be used for work, though I would recommend using a
separate notebook so as not to mix work and personal life.
