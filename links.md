I'm going to try to index interesting webpages here in an attempt to fight against the sea of Internet garbage. Good pages are getting harder to find, as the web becomes more and more controlled by special interests and more unsearchable.

## Links

- [Oblique Strategies](http://stoney.sb.org/eno/oblique.html): Stimulate your problem-solving and creativity.
- [Álvaro Ramírez](https://xenodium.com/): Blog about Emacs and OSX
- [Blog Surf](https://blogsurf.io/): A directory of personal blogs.
